# **FreshExpress**

## **Amazon HackOn submission for team CodingAlphas**

30th MAY 2021

# Introduction & Background

After the immense success of [<u>Flex</u>](https://flex.amazon.in/) &
[<u>IHS</u>](https://ihs.mobinius.com/website/) programmes in India we
are happy to announce the launch of a fresh new idea which can
supposedly change the lives of millions of people in India -
**FreshExpress.** This is our unique take on the much touted
**Hyperlocal** delivery model which can save Amazon a lot of money in
terms of revenue and shipping costs. Last mile delivery, also known as
last mile logistics, is the transportation of goods from a distribution
hub to the final delivery destination — the door of the customer. The
goal of last mile delivery logistics is to deliver the packages as
affordably, quickly and accurately as possible.The last mile of your
product’s delivery accounts for more than **53%** of the total shipping
costs. Given that the vast majority of deliveries are small packages,
these numbers reflect small parcels rather than large cargo.

The hyperlocal marketplace as the name suggests is a market that caters
to the needs of a limited geographical area. A walk around your
residence would most definitely make you come across a similar market,
however big or small but self-sufficient in its own right, fulfilling
almost all the requirements of the local residents. The USP of
hyperlocal e-commerce businesses lies in their ability to deliver
products and services at unbelievably fast speed. With the
implementation of our model any business can accelerate their growth by
using the following features.

1.  Auto-detection of customer’s location

2.  Shipment scheduling

3.  Product filtering based on location

4.  Automatic shop suggestion based on unique recommendation engine

The objective of this model is to locate a source providing the best
overall value to the customer at the least possible time.By fixing the
price of the products in hyperlocal “stores” defined in a given
geographic region Amazon can benefit from the program by reducing the
“last-mile” delivery costs to a fraction of the previous amount while at
the same time gaining new customers by providing a fast,efficient and
streamlined delivery system.

# 

# Business Model & Proposals

The following Business model & Requirements apply to this Proposal:

There are two components of a business model — qualitative and
quantitative. Let us begin by looking into its ***qualitative*** aspects:

**Value Proposition :** The fundamental proposition of the company to
the various stakeholders is simple and may be described as follows:

1.  **User --** The service offers convenience of saving time by
     delivering the items in the shortest possible amount of time.It
     also offers a plethora of options to choose from the hyperlocal
     market.

2.  **Store --** Increased sales due to higher discoverability &
     visibility amongst the densely populated residential areas along
     with better mapping and management of inventory. Amazon also
     provides credit and advisory services to help these “Amazon”
     stores. Local “Amazon” stores affiliated with “Amazon” at every
     nook and corner of the locality.

3.  **Runner --** Works as pleases for some extra monthly income. Is
     always tied up with a local store. ”Amazon
     [<u>Flex</u>](https://flex.amazon.in/)” service & “Amazon prime”
     1-day guaranteed delivery as backup in case of unique product
     items not available in any of the hyperlocal stores.

4.  **Investors --** FreshExpress becomes a ‘SuperApp’ solely owned by
     “Amazon” and controls most of the online market harnessing the
     power of data & technology to further improve/expand the business.
     The last mile delivery problem for the investor is solved along
     with some extra income in the range of (**5-10%**) per transaction
     which can be charged from the Stores for using their provided
     services and app.

**Market Opportunity :** The market size in India for online grocery is
currently just [<u>0.2% of the overall grocery market and is expected to
touch
1.2%</u>](https://www.livemint.com/industry/retail/india-s-online-grocery-retail-market-to-touch-10-5-billion-by-2023-redseer-11572008045038.html)
of the overall by 2023. There are several possible reasons for this. One
is the definition of the market. Hyperlocal today encompasses more
markets than it did earlier in 2015. Second is the expansion of the
market. Newer ideas such as medicine delivery, homecare services and
particularly micro delivery(Milk and other essentials) have seen
exponential growth in terms of the number of users. Users of these
services can prove to be stickier than those of food delivery and
ride-hailing.

**Market Dynamics :** The demand side for the applications composed of
its paying customers. They would like to order
grocery/cosmetics/electronics items and goods. The supply side however
comprises a 3-sided marketplace consisting of Kirana/Mall/Shop who is
the provider of the service & goods whereas the delivery personnel owned
by the Kirana/Mall/Shop connects the provider to the customer. On
expansion of this model to use cases other than food/grocery anybody can
become a provider/runner. Continuous promotion of this model and primary
network effect would lead to more local stores to be available in any
locality providing “Amazon” with more revenue per se.

A few **quantitative** aspects of this model are as follows :

**Revenue Streams :** Income for hyperlocal delivery companies usually
comes from merchant commissions and delivery fees from customers.
Further, depending on the type of product offerings, such as in the case
of subscriptions in the microdelivery segment, revenue streams may vary.
Commissions fall in the sub 10% range for grocery delivery companies and
can be between 10% and 15% for electronics goods providing companies.
Amazon can also make money from brand advertisements displayed on their
apps.

**Cost Structures :** The cost structure generally tends to be variable.
These are usually the consequences that stem from the choices the
management makes. Paying per delivery may help on-boarding runners but
is not sustainable in the long run and can severely impact the unit
economics. Rather, paying for timed slots would change the cost
structure to fixed and can improve profitability as the business
scales.This needs to be discussed with store owners as they will be the
sole decision makers for the delivery part of the service.Surprise
quality inspections has to be made on local stores to check the quality
of products being sold in stores. With our unique **rating &
recommendation** system a point based approach will be awarded to the
shops so that the quality of the product and the services are maintained
beforehand.Training costs for “runner” has to be borne by Amazon.

**Societal & Economic impacts : [<u>Jeff Bezos says Amazon will invest
$1 billion in digitising Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) in
India</u>](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/timeline-amazons-india-journey-under-jeff-bezos/articleshow/80670696.cms?from=mdr#:~:text=July%202014%3A%20Jeff%20Bezos%20says,e%2Dcommerce%20business%20in%20India.&text=February%202016%3A%20Amazon%20launches%20its,Amazon%20Fresh%20in%20August%202019.)**.
With the advent of this model, the Micro Small & Medium Enterprises
(MSMEs) & Small & Medium Business(SMBs) will benefit a lot. Every small
business can be a part of a big brand as “Amazon” and every runner will
be provided with a part-time and full-time income. Local entrepreneurs
not only know their neighborhoods very well, but also enjoy the goodwill
of their communities. This makes them an excellent choice as local
delivery persons & store keepers especially within small localities.
This will attract store owners to earn an extra income over and above
their primary income. Moreover this will help small towns and cities
where Amazon warehouses are still not available and the cost of
delivering items is still huge. This model will save huge costs for the
company and will provide a medium for the small/medium storekeepers to
earn an extra source of income above and beyond their usual means. The
“runners” will also be provided with training and education along with
customary rewards for their service to this programme.

# Project Description

## The purpose of this project is as follows:

1.  Conversion from Unorganized retailing to organized retailing

2.  Connecting all the local stores via digital plattform

3.  Reducing the latent distance between the sellers and buyers .

4.  Facilitating easier and hassle-free replacement and alteration of products

## The components of the project is as follows:

1.  Customer-Facing Application

2.  Store-Keeper Facing Application

3.  Recommendation Engine

4.  Geo-Partitioned distributed database

### **Customer-Facing Application**

For our prototype we have implemented a fresh simple engaging
application based on the likes of Amazon which offers customers an
unique take on 3 categories of items - Grocery, Cosmetics, Electronics.
From signing up in our portal to ordering an item in the cart to
generating the invoice of the ordered items all the basic
functionalities of a user have been taken care of. In case of any issues
faced with the application or the shopping process a support chat has
been provided by one of our developers to track and solve the pending
issues as soon as possible.

### **StoreKeeper-Facing Application**

This module has been implemented as a branch of the customer-facing
application to maintain the uniformity in the User-Interface design.
Each and every one of the StoreKeepers have been provided with an option
to track their inventory and opt in/out from delivering an order item.
This will be immensely helpful for StoreKeepers to track status of items
and stack up accordingly. The Status Bar for the storekeepers is
expected to see the maximum activity whereby each storekeeper can
accept/reject an order forwarded to them by the Recommendation Engine.

### **Recommendation Engine**

This module is responsible for the efficient interaction between the
Customer and Shopkeeper along with providing an accurate score based on
the following criteria:

1.  Distance of the Customer from the Shops defined within a range

2.  Dynamic Rating calculation for individual shops

3.  Successful orders completed by individual shops

4.  Total number of items available for delivery by individual shops

By calculating an effective **score** for the following criteria a shop
has to maintain the highest quality and standards as is expected from
any “Amazon” store. The scores will be an indicator in future to filter
out shops and force the shopkeepers to maintain quality and quantity so
that it is not flagged by the recommendation engine. For now the scores
are being displayed as an indicator for the Customer to choose the most
appropriate store accordingly.

### **Geo-Partitioned Distributed Database**

Geo-Partitioning allows for database partitioning by location, tying
your data to a location for performance or compliance. By working with
these types of Databases ( CockroachDB ) an entire region can be broken
down into small chunks of latitudes and longitudes to serve a region
efficiently. This is very useful in our case where we can break down an
entire country/city into manageable regions and maintain the stores and
customers for the geolocation accordingly. This allows us to keep
customer data close to the user, which reduces the distance it needs to
travel, thereby reducing latency and improving user experience.

# 

# Project Scope

In India, Unorganized retailers are the biggest concern which are not
able to connect through digital platforms. Connecting the Local stores
via digital platform will help to reduce the Carbon footprint, Create
local jobs, Improving the local economy and better Customer service.

Shopping locally promotes individuality and breathes new life into
communities that are dominated by generic and commodified companies.
Local economic growth will attract new talent and professionals, who
may, in turn, create businesses of their own, enhancing a local economy
and boosting the revenue of the Company.

Our project aims to connect with local stores of particular geographical
regions and give customers a better experience of shopping by providing
them fast delivery of the purchased products and more personalized
service.

The Customers have to register themselves on the FreshExpress ,based on
the location where the customer is residing ,It searches the required
shops within their range and displays it. The customer then selects the
products listed on the webpage which product is available in that
particular area. On clicking the checkout button the orders will be sent
to the required shops and shops confirm the orders by clicking on the
accept /reject button..

### **Inventory management**

The inventory has real-time sync with a different location. So that the
customer would be able to see the right stock of the product based on
their location. It helps to map the product in the nearby locality so
that the customer is aware of it before placing the order.

### **Shopper availability and delivery**

The delivery is the most critical part of the eCommerce marketplace. The
shopkeeper can manage the delivery slot availability by clicking on the
accept /reject button ,open/close button indicating whether the
shopkeeper can deliver the order or not.

### **Checkout from various stores/vendor**

The customers have the advantage to select the shops from which shop
customers want to place the order based on the reviews and personalized
experience.This feature helps the customers to get the scalability with
the store.

### **Chat with the customer**

Many times the customers face issues during order delivery or placing of
orders e.t.c in this case. In this case, having a chat system with the
customer can really solve the problem.

## The criteria set forth below should be met to achieve successful completion of the project:

1.  Customer can order products without any problem

2.  Stores can register and list their inventory online

3.  Delivery of products should be within expected time delivery

4.  Nearest shop is selected resulting in low waiting period time

5.  In case of unavailability of items,orders should be fulfilled via
    flexible delivery

# Example Scenario

The example scenario consists of an ideal location[1] defined by our
geohash function in the
[<u>map</u>](https://goo.gl/maps/sAFyu6wCZ2A9vZyn6) here. The user
geolocation is fixed at this
[<u>point</u>](https://goo.gl/maps/ZVr2FDrE37oojZCPA) in the map. For
our scenario[2] we are running a live simulation by registering a set of
12 shops defined in the 5km range.

The shop definition along with their respective credentials are as
follows:

| SHOPNAME                        | USERID          | PASSWORD | ADDRESS IN MAP                                                                  |

When a customer logins into FreshExpress shopping portal and tries to
buy some items from a plethora of options we fetch the customer’s
geolocation as input and run it through our unique “Recommendation
Engine” to filter out the valid shops within a given 2Km range. It is
one of the many criterias which we are using to define a valid score for
a shop so that the customer is always given the option to choose from
the best. Once the customer places their order the shopkeepers are
notified of the order items and they can accept/reject that order in
their respective portals accordingly. Once the order is finalized by any
of the shopkeepers it's time for the customers to choose their favorite
stores accordingly. Once the store is finalized it is the time for the
runners to do their part and deliver the order in the shortest possible
time. In case of item unavailability the order will be forwarded to the
nearest Amazon warehouse for successful delivery via Amazon Flex.

Once the item has been delivered by the runner and the transaction
amount is collected a feedback loop for the order rating is run and the
recommendation engine gets ready for the next available store for order
item delivery.

This procedure is run multiple times without fail guaranteeing
uninterrupted services to the customer by the shopkeepers and solving
the “Last-Mile” problem for Amazon.

# Evaluation Factors

Logistics, as the backbone of the e-commerce industry needs to be
optimal in order for the industry to thrive and grow. In India people
tend to buy many items from local grocery stores and stores. Meeting the
needs of a customer by providing products and services within an hour is
a challenging task.

Local retailers and stores collaborating with online platforms to employ
hyperlocal strategy would help their business. A hyperlocal strategy
would bring considerable improvements to the aspect of rapid delivery.

Hyperlocal strategy can be a key differentiator and driver for
businesses. It has the potential to bring more local clients to local
stores and dramatically reduce inventory and logistics expenses of
online shopping platforms.It also has a considerable appeal to consumers
given the possibility of unforeseen reduction in delivery times.Many of
the options were developed in the past such as last mile delivery,crowd
shipping but none were completely helpful. Connecting local stores with
the online platform and expanding their business would increase their
business sales and also helps to connect every store globally improving
the brand image overall.

# Active Issues

1.  “Get your location” button in the homepage is not working . The
     button takes user location through HTML Geolocation API and prints
     in the console. For our test scenario we have defined an ideal
     region in the [<u>map</u>](https://goo.gl/maps/sAFyu6wCZ2A9vZyn6)
     with 12 nearby shops. 
     **Possible Resolutions :** Once the
     prototype is successfully implemented and business data is
     collected this model can be extended and implemented to every
     location in any region in India. The user location will then be
     stored into a database for further processing by the
     recommendation engine.

2.  “CockroachDB Enterprise Issue” : [<u>Geo-partitioning requires an
     Enterprise
     license.</u>](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.2/topology-geo-partitioned-replicas.html)
     Unavailability of Enterprise License for Geo-Partitioning won’t allow
     us to test this feature of GeoPartitioning a massive database
     according to the specified regions as defined previously in our
     project.
     **Possible Resolutions :** Work on sample data defined within a given
     range, looking out for alternative databases accordingly which allow
     users to geopartition data for free.

# 

# Future Plans

1.  Drone Based Delivery Subsystem using Amazon Air.

2.  Use of the existing transportation systems to facilitate faster deliveries.

3.  Amazon Pay payment integration for faster checkouts and payment processing.

4.  Amazon Flex integration with the existing application.

[1] 5km range with 12 valid shops.

[2] Geo-Partitioning a database is not possible due to unavailability of
Enterprise License.
